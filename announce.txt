What is logilab.aspects?
------------------------

logilab.aspects is a python package that enables Aspect Oriented
Programming in Python. For now, it provides a set of ready-to-use
aspects, and an easy way to create your own aspects. The current
possibilities are still a bit limited, but it will soon provide a more
exhaustive way to define and use more complex aspects.

The aspects module contains some useful aspects such as:

 * LoggerAspect:  trace all method calls.
 * ContractAspect: contracts can be seen as a sub-part of aspects,
   and this particular aspect will allow you to use contracts in
   Python. We have choosen to consider contracts definitions as a part 
   of documentation. The conditions are thus specified in method and 
   modules docstrings.
 * ProfilerAspect:  simple method profiler 
 * DispatcherAspect: enable multimethods
 * ConfirmationAspect: ask confirmation before an operation
 * ObserverAspect: aspect implementation of the Observer Design Pattern

logilab.aspects is free software distributed under the GNU Public Licence.
