ChangeLog for logilab.aspects
=============================

2005-11-29  --  0.1.4 

    * Fixed some aspects.prototypes bugs

2005-06-15 -- 0.1.3
    * better unittest code coverage
    * __old__ is now managed with a dict instead of the ugly Holder class
    * added a __class__ key to the context dict. This seems to be enough
      to fix the 'infinite loop' bug when weaving the same aspect both on
      base and child classes

	
2003-06-18  --  0.1.2
    * Added some aspects examples. Beginning of Design Pattern implementetation
      with aspects (Observer).


2003-06-06  --  0.1.1
    * Added func.func_global in contracts' local dict (+ unittests)


2003-06-04  --  0.1.1
    * Initial release
